# Milestone-One-Project

How to play:
Use the arrow keys to move Mr. Kitty around the map to collect treasures for points.  


Why this game was made:
Originally I wanted to make a feeding frenzy type game that involved fish, maybe next time!
This new idea sprouted when I wanted to test how to use sprite sheets so I used this orange tabby cat.  I have an orange tabby cat of my own named Mr. Kitty.  This game is dedicated to Mr. Kitty.
Additionally I wanted to experiment with a large map that my chosen character could walk across and obtain points.  To my surprise the map/background actually moves while the character image itself stays staitionary whch lead me to needing to re-write my code. (At least to have my game operating how I envisioned it)


Future potential updates:
Adding collision
Adding more tile pieces
Updating Mr. Kitties images to match the background style better
Compress code 
Address diagnal walking

Credit:
This is the first project in my fullstack development course.
The tile images and icon were created by me.
The cat was taken from an opensource sprite sheet and made into several gifs
