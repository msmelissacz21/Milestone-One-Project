# Milestone-One-Project

How to play:
Use the arrow keys to move Mr. Kitty around to collect as many fish as possible in the alloted time.  The player needs to score 45 points by the time limit to win.


Why this game was made:
Originally I wanted to make a feeding frenzy type game that involved fish, maybe next time!
This new idea sprouted when I wanted to test how to use sprite sheets so I used this orange tabby cat.  I have an orange tabby cat of my own named Mr. Kitty.  This game is dedicated to Mr. Kitty.
Additionally I wanted to experiment with a large map that my chosen character could walk across and obtain points.  To my surprise the map/background actually moves while the character image itself stays staitionary whch lead me to needing to re-write my code. (At least to have my game operating how I envisioned it)


Future potential updates:
Adding collision, adding more tile pieces, updating Mr. Kitties images to match the background style better, compress code, address diagnal walking, make overall style more appealing, add dog enemy(already located in images), reconfigure scoring and winning, add music, make the map larger and more interesting, add water tiles, add buildings

Credit:
This is the first project in my fullstack development course.
The tile images and fish element were created by me.
The cat/dog were taken from an opensource sprite sheet and made into several gifs
